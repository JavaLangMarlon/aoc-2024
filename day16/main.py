# This one is tough. My first idea was to view the maze as a graph and then run something like Dijkstra on it.
# The intersections of the maze and the start and end points would be nodes in that graph and the paths between these
# positions would be the links. A problem that would probably arise is that the weights of the links change
# depending on the reindeer's orientation because it costs to turn. One possible solution is to add a node for each
# orientation per intersection, so 4 nodes for 1 intersection.
#
# To create the graph, we go through the whole maze and for every path between two intersections, we add two links for
# each direction. If we see a new intersection, we also add the 3 other nodes.
# If the graph creation works correctly, applying Dijkstra and checking for the distance to a node with the end point
# and ignoring the direction gives us the right result.
